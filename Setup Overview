Setup collects system-level metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk usage from Kubernetes nodes. 
The Node Exporter exposes these metrics, and a CronJob is used to fetch them on every 5 minutes.
The collected metrics are stored in a Persistent Volume, ensuring data persists even if Pods restart.

Dockerfile: Creates a container that runs a cron job to fetch metrics and store them.

Bash Script: Script that fetches metrics from Node Exporter and saves them in a file.

Kubernetes CronJob: Sets up a cron job in Kubernetes to run the script every 5 minutes.

Node Exporter DaemonSet: Deploys Node Exporter on every Kubernetes node to expose system metrics.

Node Exporter Service: Kubernetes Service to expose Node Exporter to other pods in the cluster. It allows the cron job to access the metrics endpoint.

Persistent Volume: PersistentVolume (PV) for storing the metrics data.

Persistent Volume Claim: PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to request storage from the Persistent Volume.

Log Storage Pod: This optional pod is used to inspect the stored metrics files.
